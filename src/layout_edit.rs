//! Writing `[layout]` changes back into the config file.
//!
//! Which panels exist and how wide they are can be changed from the dashboard,
//! and those changes have to land somewhere the user will find them. That is
//! the config: `[layout]` is the part people actually read and curate, and
//! recording it anywhere else would leave the file describing a dashboard
//! nobody is looking at.
//!
//! Rewriting is **textual**, for the reason [`crate::migrate`] gives at length
//! and does not need repeating here. Everything else — spacing, ordering,
//! comments, even a comment *inside* the layout block — is left exactly as the
//! user left it.
//!
//! There are two ways that happens, and which one runs matters. When only the
//! numbers moved — the common case, every `Ctrl+arrow` — the digits are
//! replaced on their own line and nothing else is touched, so a block someone
//! aligned by hand stays aligned. When the *structure* moved, no per-line edit
//! can say it: a panel changing places with its neighbour leaves both still
//! present with the same widths, and the old version of this module emitted
//! nothing at all for it. So a row whose membership or order changed has its
//! panels rebuilt from their captured entries instead.
//!
//! An entry is a panel's line *plus the comment lines directly above it*, and
//! entries are looked up across the whole block rather than within one row.
//! That is what lets a panel dragged to the other side of the dashboard take
//! the sentence explaining it along, instead of leaving it behind to caption
//! whatever moved into its place.
//!
//! The safety property that makes this defensible is at the bottom of
//! [`apply`]: the edited text is parsed before it is returned, and the layout it
//! produces is compared against the one that was asked for. A mismatch means
//! the surgery went wrong, and the edit is thrown away rather than written. So
//! the failure mode of an unusual config is "your change did not stick",
//! reported, rather than "your config is now broken".
