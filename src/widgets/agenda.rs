//! The agenda: what is actually next, out of a local `.ics` file.
//!
//! The gap this fills was named early and left open for a long time: tasks are
//! self-paced, and a meeting is not. A dashboard that can tell you four things
//! and none of them is "you are in a call in ten minutes" is missing the one
//! with a deadline attached.
//!
//! Deliberately **offline**. mirador does not sign into a calendar server, and
//! is not going to — that is an account, a token to refresh, and a background
//! process with opinions about your credentials. It reads a file. Whatever put
//! the file there is your business: an export, a `vdirsyncer` run, a cron job
//! with `curl`, a symlink into a synced folder.
//!
//! The `calendar` widget beside this one is a date grid and stays that way. One
//! answers "what is the date", the other "what is next", and squeezing both
//! into one panel does neither well.
