//! Weather: current conditions plus an hour-by-hour forecast.
//!
//! Data comes from Open-Meteo, which needs no API key and no account — that is
//! what keeps mirador's "no registration" promise credible. All network I/O
//! happens on a background thread; the panel only ever reads a mutex-guarded
//! snapshot, so a slow or hung request can never stall the render loop.
//!
//! The forecast is hourly rather than daily because the question a dashboard
//! answers is "what is the rest of my day like", not "what is the week like".
//! Each row is labelled with the hour it applies to, which the previous daily
//! layout left the reader to infer.
