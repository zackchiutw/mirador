//! Headlines: a window on the world, not a feed.
//!
//! This is the panel that came closest to the one this dashboard turned down.
//! Unread counts were rejected for being "a doomscroll hook" that "turns a calm
//! dashboard into a nagging one", and news is *the* doomscroll surface —
//! unbounded, constantly moving, and written by professionals to be clicked.
//!
//! So the commitment is the same shape as the watch log's, and it is
//! presentational:
//!
//! - **However many stories fit, and no more.** There is no scrolling and no
//!   "more below". You cannot work through it, because there is nothing to work
//!   through. `render` keeps only the stories whose whole block fits the body,
//!   so the selection cannot leave the viewport and `List` has nothing to
//!   scroll. This was documentation rather than behaviour until #118 — every
//!   story became an item and the panel scrolled through all twelve — and the
//!   tests at the foot of this file are what stop it drifting back.
//! - **No count anywhere.** Not in the frame, not in the body.
//! - **Nothing is new.** No unread state, no marker, no reordering to put fresh
//!   items on top beyond the newest-first order they already have.
//! - **Refreshed hourly**, which is slower than news moves and about as often
//!   as a person should want to know.
//!
//! You glance at it the way you glance at the weather glass. Break any of those
//! and this becomes the feature that was turned down.
//!
//! Headlines only, never the summary — see [`crate::feed`] for why.
//!
//! **No browser is launched that the reader did not name.** That is a narrowing
//! of what this note used to say, which was that no browser is launched at all,
//! "the same answer this project gave to playing a sound file". The analogy was
//! doing more work than it could carry: the sound decision was about a
//! *dependency chain* — `rodio` reaching `cpal` reaching `alsa-sys`, C headers
//! on every Linux builder — and spawning a process costs none of that. What
//! actually settled the sound question was `[pomodoro].chime_command`: mirador
//! does not pick the program, you name it. `[news].open_command` is that same
//! answer, and empty by default, so the shipped dashboard still launches
//! nothing.
