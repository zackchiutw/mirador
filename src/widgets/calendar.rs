//! Calendar: the current month and the ones after it, laid out the way `cal`
//! prints them.
//!
//! The panel answers "what is the date, and how far away is that?" — the
//! question a wall calendar answers and a clock does not. Showing the next
//! month alongside this one is the whole point: the useful lookups near a
//! month's end ("the 3rd is a Tuesday") fall off the edge of a single month.
//!
//! Deliberately offline and read-only. Reading an `.ics` file and showing
//! actual events is a separate, larger panel; this one is a date grid.
