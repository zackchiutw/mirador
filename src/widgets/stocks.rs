//! The stock watchlist.
//!
//! One of the four questions the dashboard exists to answer: what is the
//! portfolio doing. It shows last price, the day's change in both currency and
//! percent, and an intraday sparkline.
//!
//! Fetching happens on a background thread and the panel reads a mutex-guarded
//! snapshot, as the weather panel does — a panel that blocks freezes the whole
//! dashboard. Symbols are requested **one at a time with a pause between
//! them**, not concurrently: a burst of parallel requests is what gets an IP
//! rate-limited, and a watchlist has no deadline.
//!
//! Prices are never written to disk. Only the list of symbols is persisted, and
//! that lives in a data file rather than in the config, which is what lets the
//! panel edit it — mirador deliberately never rewrites its config.
