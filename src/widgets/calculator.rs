//! A calculator, drawn as an adding machine's tape.
//!
//! The arithmetic lives in [`crate::calc`]; this is the instrument around it.
//!
//! # Why this panel exists
//!
//! It answers none of the four questions the dashboard was built for, which is
//! the same thing that is true of the pomodoro timer. Both are here because
//! they were asked for — this one by a reader, and endorsed. Recorded so the
//! next person does not conclude the filter was forgotten.
//!
//! There is an argument for it beyond that, and it is about *reaching* rather
//! than reading. mirador's whole premise is a tab left open all day; the thing
//! you actually reach for during that day is a quick sum, and the alternative
//! is `bc` or `python3 -c` in a shell you have to go and find. This is the
//! first panel that is purely an instrument, with no data source behind it at
//! all.
//!
//! # Why a tape and not a big number
//!
//! **The first version drew the answer in block numerals, and it was wrong.**
//! The reasoning behind it was "the clock and the pomodoro use them", which is
//! a resemblance rather than a reason. Those two show one continuously changing
//! value that you *glance* at, and the numerals exist so it reads from across
//! the room. A calculated answer is not glanced at — it is read once and
//! checked against the working that produced it. Different job, different
//! instrument.
//!
//! There was an arithmetic tell as well: block numerals cost six cells a digit,
//! so a twelve-digit result wants ninety-four columns. At any ordinary panel
//! width the numerals only ever appeared for answers small enough not to need
//! them.
//!
//! What replaced it is the adding machine's tape, and that is not nostalgia.
//! The reason accountants still buy printing calculators is *audit*: the tape
//! is what lets you check the entry you made three lines ago. It also belongs
//! to the design thesis, which is a watch station — chronometer, weather glass,
//! watch log. A tape sits on that bench; a seven-segment display does not.
//!
//! Built on [`crate::grid`] rather than hand-composed, which is what every
//! other list panel here does and what makes it look like part of the same
//! instrument. It also means "never show a truncated number" is enforced by the
//! shared column machinery rather than by hand.
//!
//! # The input problem, and why `captures_input` stays false
//!
//! A calculator needs the digits, and `1`–`9` are the shell's jump-to-panel
//! keys. The obvious fix is [`Panel::captures_input`], and it is a trap: that
//! is an *absolute* veto (invariant 2), meant for transient modal states like
//! typing a task title. A panel that captured permanently would kill `Tab`,
//! `q` and `?` for as long as it held focus — a room with no door.
//!
//! It is not needed. `App::dispatch_key` offers every key to the focused panel
//! *first* and consults the global table only if the panel returns `Ignored`.
//! So this panel consumes what it needs and ignores the rest, and every global
//! key except the digits keeps working.
//!
//! The price, stated plainly because it is a real one: **while this panel is
//! focused, `1`–`9` type digits instead of jumping to panels.** `Tab` still
//! cycles, which is the way out.
