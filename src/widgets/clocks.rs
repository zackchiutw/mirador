/// that will not fit. The clock's border holds about four.
///
/// `Shift+↑↓` is a primary and sits above `d`, which is a deliberate swap made
/// after #109 shipped. Reordering is the thing that issue was filed for — "no
/// way to change order of TZ list via kbd" — and as an `extra` it appeared only
/// in the help overlay, so the border advertised `e edit` and said nothing about
/// the headline capability. The owner went looking for it in a released build
/// and concluded it had not been implemented. A key nobody can find is a key
/// that does not exist.
///
/// `a add` rather than `a add zone` for the same reason: the four together need
/// 42 cells against a budget of `width - 8`, which is 43 on the default layout.
/// The panel is a list of zones and the word buys nothing.
///
/// `d remove` is the one that drops at that width, and it is the right one to
/// lose: `d` deletes in the task, notes and watchlist panels too, so a reader who
/// has used any of them already knows it. `s` and the move keys are idiosyncratic
/// to this panel and guessable from nothing. A wider clock shows all five.
