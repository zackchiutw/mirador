# CLAUDE.md — working notes for mirador

Context for anyone (human or agent) picking this repo up cold. Design rationale
that belongs to users lives in `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`; this file is
the stuff you would otherwise have to reverse-engineer from the diff.

There was a `HANDOFF.md` alongside this carrying the perishable half — where
work stopped, what was waiting on a decision. Its open items are all either
done or folded in below, so it has been deleted as it asked to be. Write
another the same way if you hand off mid-flight, and delete it the same way.

## What this is

A personal information dashboard for the terminal, in Rust + ratatui. Clock,
weather, tasks, and live system metrics in a config-driven grid. MIT licensed.
Repo: `github.com/jchultarsky/mirador`. Owner: Julian Chultarsky.

A *mirador* is a lookout — the tower you climb to see everything at once.

**Known name collision, accepted knowingly:** Project Mirador, the IIIF image
viewer. Raised before the name was chosen; not a reason to revisit it.

## The one-line pitch that shapes every decision

A tab you leave open all day and come back to. That constrains more than it
sounds like it does: no ambient blinking, no shimmering graphs, no doomscroll
hooks, calm by default so that *not* calm is legible at a glance.

## Commands

```sh
cargo test                                    # all fast, no network, no fixtures
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings     # must be silent
cargo fmt --all -- --check                    # must be silent
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" \
  cargo doc --no-deps --document-private-items  # CI runs this; it caught a
                                                # broken intra-doc link that
                                                # the other three did not
cargo run -- --print-config > /tmp/m.toml     # scratch config to experiment on
cargo run -- --config /tmp/m.toml
```

**The bar is zero warnings and zero errors across all four.** Running only the
first three is how a red build reached `main`: rustdoc rejects a link to a
`cfg(test)` item, and nothing else notices.

`rust-version` is driven by dependencies, and `cargo` reports only the *first*
blocker — chasing them one at a time costs a CI round trip each. Get the real
floor in one go:

```sh
cargo metadata --format-version 1 | \
  jq -r '[.packages[].rust_version | select(.)] | max'
```

It currently comes from `sysinfo`, not from anything this crate does. **Seven
places have to agree, across four files**: `Cargo.toml`;
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` twice, the step name and the toolchain; `README.md`
twice, the badge URL and the prose; and `CONTRIBUTING.md` twice, the prose and
the `cargo +1.95.0` invocation. This note said "five" and counted the README
and CONTRIBUTING once each — and the two it missed, a badge and a pinned
toolchain, are exactly the two that fail loudly and late.

Note that `rust-version` also changes what clippy suggests — raising
the MSRV to 1.88 turned every nested `if let` into a `collapsible_if` error,
because let-chains only became available there, and 1.88 → 1.95 turned every
`Duration::from_secs(3600)` into one, because `from_hours` had stabilised.
Expect a round of mechanical fixes with any bump, and do not take the
suggestion on faith: clippy will offer `from_days`, which is *still unstable*
at the 1.95 floor and would break the very job the bump was fixing.

This cuts the other way too, and it is worth knowing before you go hunting.
**Clippy gating means a local run and CI can legitimately disagree**: bump
`rust-version` locally, run clippy, and you will see lints a CI still on the
old floor does not. That is the gate working, not CI failing. Compare the
`rust-version` each side is using before concluding anything is broken.

The crate enables `clippy::pedantic`. When a lint is genuinely wrong, add a
targeted `#[allow]` *with a comment saying why* — do not widen the allow list
in `Cargo.toml`.

**`assets/default_config.toml` is `include_str!`-baked into the binary.**
Editing it does nothing until you rebuild. This has twice looked like a change
that did not land when it simply had not been compiled.

To eyeball the rendering without a terminal:

```sh
cargo test dump_dashboard -- --ignored --nocapture   # renders to stdout
```

To drive it in a real terminal headlessly, run it under `tmux` and
`tmux capture-pane -p`. Several layout bugs only showed up this way — the
`TestBackend` dump will not catch a panel whose content is pushed off the
bottom, because nothing errors. `-e` keeps the escape sequences, which is the
only way to prove a colour bug; a capture of black-on-black shows nothing
either way.

**A test that cannot fail is documentation with a `#[test]` on it.** The id
reuse bug shipped with `ids_are_unique_and_survive_deletion` sitting directly
on top of it: the test compared the new id against the *surviving* task rather
than the *removed* one, so it passed throughout. When you fix a bug that had a
test nearby, check that the test would have caught it — break the fix on
purpose and watch it go red. Twice now that check was the difference between a
real test and a reassuring one.

## Architecture

```
main.rs      CLI parsing, terminal setup
app.rs       event loop, focus ring, grid geometry, help overlay, status bar
panel.rs     the Panel trait — the seam every widget goes through (in-tree)
frame.rs     panel frames, Binding type, key hints punched into borders
grid.rs      shared column grid with named headers
chart.rs     braille graphs + baked colour gradients
glyphs.rs    block numerals, bold-uppercase labels, weather art
theme.rs     colours and gradient stops
themes.rs    `theme = "name"`: bundled themes, inherits, palettes
config/      mod.rs: paths, loading, validation; widgets.rs: one settings
             struct per panel; layout.rs: the grid
picker.rs    the `w` dialog — owns its cursor, returns an Action to the shell
theme_picker.rs the `t` dialog — same shape, but previews as the cursor moves
arrange.rs   the `m` mode's arithmetic: where a panel goes when you move it
prompt.rs    the one-line question a panel asks for a path, place or zone,
             with an optional list to choose from
zones.rs     world clocks as a data file, plus the city→zone table
migrate.rs   textual in-place upgrade of configs written by older versions
layout_edit.rs surgical `[layout]` rewrites, so panel changes reach the config
store.rs     write_atomic — every file mirador owns goes through it
state.rs     UI-changed preferences, remembered across restarts
update.rs    the opt-in update check — off unless the config turns it on
upgrade.rs   `--update`: hands an installer copy to `mirador-update` and a
             crates.io copy back to Cargo, and refuses anything it does not own
watch.rs     the watch log's events and the rule that decides what is one
feed.rs      enough RSS for a headline; quick-xml, unlike ical.rs — see below
task.rs      task model + TOML store
note.rs      note model + TOML store
quote.rs     Quote + the pluggable QuoteSource trait + the watchlist store
poll.rs      the sliced sleep the background threads share — weather,
             stocks and news fetch; agenda reloads a file
samples.rs   the bounded history behind the cpu and network graphs
selection.rs list cursor movement and click-to-row
clipboard.rs OSC 52, with base64 hand-rolled rather than taken as a dependency
textfield.rs single-line text editor used by task entry
textarea.rs  multi-line text editor used by note bodies, with the
             selection the notes clipboard acts on
dateinput.rs due-date entry
ical.rs      enough RFC 5545 to answer "what is next"; no new dependencies
calc.rs      the calculator's parser: precedence, brackets, bounded depth
docs.rs      the guard on *this file* — cited tests, version, paths, and that
             every module below is listed
widgets/     clocks, weather, todo, notes, stocks, calendar, agenda,
             pomodoro, watchlog, news, cpu, memory, network, calculator
```

`Panel` has two input hooks. `handle_key` goes to the *focused* panel;
`handle_mouse` goes to the panel under the *pointer*, which is deliberately not
the same thing — a scroll wheel must move the list it is aimed at without
yanking the keyboard away from what the user was typing in.

Adding a widget: implement `Panel`, add a config struct to `config/widgets.rs`,
add the name to `WIDGET_NAMES` and an arm to `build()` in `widgets/mod.rs`,
document it in `assets/default_config.toml` and the README. Nothing else needs
to know. `CONTRIBUTING.md` has the same list with more detail — this one is the
map, that one is the procedure.

## Invariants — do not break these

1. **Panels must never block.** Network and disk I/O go on a background thread
   and are polled in `tick()`; see `widgets/weather.rs`. A blocking panel
   freezes the whole dashboard.
2. **`Panel::captures_input()` is an absolute veto on global keys**, and
   **there is always exactly one way out that no panel can take.** The veto is
   what stops typing `q` into a task title from quitting. The exception is what
   stops that from being a trap.

   Today the exception is Ctrl+C, and it is safe because panels save as they
   go. But **the rule is the guarantee, not the key**: someone who is stuck —
   mid-form, mid-selection, in a state they do not recognise — has to be able
   to leave *without first working out what state they are in*. A panel that
   consumes the escape under some condition has not added a feature; it has
   made the guarantee conditional on the reader diagnosing their own situation,
   which is precisely what they cannot do.

   If a panel genuinely needs Ctrl+C for itself — a text editor wanting it for
   copy is the obvious case — then the second press must be unconditional, so
   that **"Ctrl+C twice always quits"** stays sayable. Consuming it and leaving
   the condition standing is the failure mode: in review of #177 a text
   selection took Ctrl+C and never cleared itself, so the key copied for ever
   and never quit.

   This was written as "Ctrl+C is the sole exception" for a year, which was
   true and useless — it described the mechanism, so the first change to the
   mechanism made the sentence wrong instead of making the change look wrong.
3. **One `Binding` declaration feeds three surfaces** — border hint, status bar,
   help overlay. Never hardcode hint text anywhere else; it will drift.
4. **Hints are shown only for the focused panel.** A flat list of every binding
   teaches people to press panel keys while the wrong panel is focused.
5. **Grid columns are resolved once per draw for the whole list**, not per row.
   Per-row was a real bug: a task with no due date slid every row below it out
   of alignment.
6. **Every column of a header gets the same treatment.** Mixed treatment reads
   as an accident (`DONE PRI T A S K`). This used to need real machinery, since
   a letterspaced label could overflow a narrow column and demote the whole row;
   the bold face costs no extra width, so the question no longer arises.
7. **Task writes are atomic** (temp file + rename) and save failures surface in
   the panel. A silent failed save on a task list is unforgivable.
8. **Body text is `Color::Reset`.** Hard-coding a foreground fights the user's
   own terminal theme.
9. **Measure text in display cells, never in `chars()`.** `grid.rs` uses
   `unicode-width`. This is not pedantry: a glyph like `☀` or an emoji occupies
   two cells, so counting characters silently shifts every column after it and
   values end up under the wrong headers. This was a real, shipped bug.
10. **Sky marks must measure the width they draw.** Several obvious weather
    emoji — U+1F327 rain cloud, U+1F328 snow cloud, U+2601 cloud, U+1F32B fog —
    report width 1 from `unicode-width` but render as two cells. Only glyphs
    that measure 2 *and* draw 2 are used. `every_sky_mark_has_a_predictable_display_width`
    asserts this; if you swap a glyph and that test fails, believe it.
11. **Never render an empty cell in a table.** A blank reads as "this column is
    broken"; `0%` reads as "it is not going to rain", which is the fact the
    reader wanted. Use `–` for genuinely unknown.
12. **A config number that describes content is a floor, not a ceiling.**
    `[cpu].history = 120` capped the graph at 60 cells, so a wider panel drew
    dead space; the buffer now grows to the width. Before adding a count to a
    config, ask what happens when the panel is bigger than the count implies.
13. **Anything time-dependent must re-derive itself on a tick.** The dashboard
    runs for days: a `today` captured at construction silently rots, and
    overdue tasks stop being red. `todo`, `notes` and `calendar` all re-read the
    date in `tick()` and rebuild when it rolls over.
14. **A fetch failure must not discard good data — except for prices.** Weather
    keeps its last reading and shows its age, because old weather is useful and
    a blank panel is not. Quotes do the opposite and fall back to `–`: a stale
    price read as live is worse than no price, which is the same reasoning that
    keeps quotes out of any file on disk.
15. **A panel that cannot use more space must say so**, via `Panel::max_width`
    / `max_height`. Otherwise proportional layout hands it space it cannot use
    while a list next door runs out. Return `None` for anything that scrolls or
    scales; return a figure only when more space genuinely buys the reader
    nothing. Both are whole-panel measurements, frame and padding included.
16. **The config is edited, never reserialised.** This is the real form of the
    "never rewrites the config" rule, which was always about comments: a round
    trip through `toml` discards all 296 of them, including the ones mirador
    wrote to explain its own options. `migrate.rs` established the alternative
    and `layout_edit.rs` follows it — find the line, change that line, leave
    everything else alone. Adding a panel is a one-line diff.

    What makes it safe to do at all is the check at the end of
    `layout_edit::apply`: the edited text is parsed and compared against the
    layout that was requested, and a mismatch throws the edit away. So an
    unusually formatted config fails as "your change did not stick", reported
    in the picker, rather than as a mangled file.

    The split is by *what*, not by convenience: `[layout]` goes to the config
    because people read and curate it, and everything else goes to `state.rs`
    because nobody keeps their preferred sort order under version control.
17. **A remembered preference is the difference between the panels and the
    config.** `Panel::remember` reports current values unconditionally;
    `UiState::only_changes_from` drops whatever matches
    `UiState::from_config(config_as_loaded)`. The baseline has to be taken
    *before* `apply_state`, or it already contains last session's changes and
    nothing can be seen to differ from it.

    Two wrong versions were shipped before this one, and both looked right:

    - Reporting current values with no comparison pinned every panel's config
      values into the state file on the first keystroke anywhere, after which
      editing the config silently stopped working.
    - Having each panel compare against the value it was *built* with fixed
      that, and made a preference impossible to *un*-set: after `apply_state`
      the panel is built from the remembered value, so a setting toggled back
      to what the config says looked unchanged, wrote nothing, and left the
      earlier entry standing for ever.

    Both passed their unit tests. The first was caught by running it; the second
    by an adversarial review reading the data flow. Keep the comparison in one
    place, against the config, and it is symmetric by construction.

18. **First run must not be blank, and the defaults must agree.** The task and
    notes stores seed examples via `load_or_seed`, keyed on the file being
    *absent* — never on it being empty, or deleting the examples would not
    stick. The seeded titles are instructions, so they have to fit the task
    column at an ordinary width; `seeded_titles_fit_the_task_column_at_an_ordinary_width`
    pins that at 25 cells, which is what the default layout leaves at 120
    columns. Separately, `Layout::default()` and the `[layout]` block in
    `assets/default_config.toml` must describe the same dashboard — they are
    reached by different routes, and when they diverged, a config without a
    `[layout]` section silently lost three panels.

    Note for tests: constructing `TodoPanel`/`NotesPanel` against a path with
    no file now seeds it. Panel tests write an empty file first, which is the
    branch every run after the first one takes.

19. **Nothing may be drawn wider than the space it was given.** A line built at
    its natural width and handed to a `Paragraph` is not truncated by mirador —
    it is truncated by the *terminal*, which keeps the cells that fit and
    discards the rest in silence. The terminal cannot tell a value from a
    fragment, so it cuts wherever the edge falls, and a fragment of a value is
    not a smaller truth. `↑ 6.4 KB` is a total where a rate was meant, `+52.0`
    is a price nobody quoted, `humidity` with no figure is a label over nothing,
    and `13 1` under a calendar's THU is Thursday the 1st.

    Two mechanisms, and which one applies is decided by what the text *is*:

    - **Values drop whole.** `grid::assemble` takes a line as a list of parts
      and drops from the end until it fits; `Grid` does the same for table
      columns via `drops_below`. A part is anything that means nothing on its
      own — a figure and its unit, an arrow and what it points at. Put the
      separator at the *front* of the part it introduces, so a dropped part
      takes its separator with it and no line ends in a dangling `·`.
    - **Prose is ellipsised.** `grid::truncate` for one line, `grid::wrap` for
      several. The `…` is the whole point: it is the difference between a
      message the reader knows is abridged and one they do not.

    Where a value would be dropped only because of its own *padding*, drop the
    padding first — the network and cpu readouts pad to a fixed field so the
    figures hold still, and give that up rather than the second reading.

    This was found late, and by looking rather than by any test failing: nine
    modules built composite lines by hand and four were cutting values at
    ordinary terminal sizes, one of them in the shipped 120-column default.
    `no_grid_in_the_program_ever_overflows_its_width` sweeps every declared
    column set at every width, `every_grid_in_the_program_is_on_this_list`
    keeps that sweep complete, and
    `every_hand_built_composite_line_in_a_widget_is_accounted_for` counts what
    is left and makes a new one justify itself.

    **A render-level sweep cannot check this, and it was tried first.** A
    buffer records what the terminal *kept*, so an overflowing line and a line
    that happens to end there are the same bytes. Overflow has to be caught
    where the line is built.

## Visual system

Design thesis: *the watch station*. The vernacular is a lookout's instrument
panel — chronometer, weather glass, watch log.

- **Palette:** brass `#d7af87` (instruments, focus, clock), verdigris `#5f8787`
  (engraved labels, tags), slate `#3a3a3a` (chrome). Signals: red `#d75f5f`,
  amber `#d7af5f`, moss `#87af5f`.
- **Three manufactured typefaces**, since a terminal has one font: block
  numerals (display), the terminal's own face (body), **bold uppercase**
  (utility/labels, via `glyphs::utility`). Weight and case separate label from
  data without relying on colour and without costing width.

  **Reversed decision:** the utility face was letterspaced — `N E X T  H O U R S`
  — on the theory that tracking reads as an engraved instrument label. The owner
  rejected it on sight: it reads as stretched, not engraved. Do not reintroduce
  it. Tracking also more than doubled every label, which is why the grid header
  needed all-or-nothing demotion logic; that logic is gone with it.
- **Focus by recession** — dim the unfocused, never brighten the focused, so
  exactly one thing is at full brightness.
- **The frame is a widget bus**, not decoration. Titles, jump keys, counters and
  hints are punched into the border with `┤label├`, costing zero interior rows.

### Techniques borrowed, and why

From **bpytop/btop**: braille 5×5 level table (2 samples per cell, 4 levels per
row); gradient runs **vertically by magnitude**, one colour per row — this is
deliberate and worth defending, a static colour profile means the graph does not
shimmer as data scrolls; three-stop gradients baked to a 101-entry table with
`start` dark and desaturated so idle graphs recede; the same ramp colours graph,
meter and number together; always paint a track (`⣀` baseline, `■` meter tail)
so the footprint never changes.

From **clock-tui**: run-length row glyph encoding plus an integer scale
multiplier — 13 glyphs in ~20 lines and free scaling, much better than
hand-drawn string art.

From **gitui/lazygit/ratatui's own tutorial**: focus by dimming; hints in the
bottom border; jump key in the title.

## Product decisions already settled

**The four things the dashboard exists to answer:** what time/day is it, what
tasks are next, what is the portfolio doing, what compute is available.

**Two panels answer none of them and are here anyway.** The pomodoro was asked
for directly by the owner; the calculator was suggested by a reader and
endorsed. Both are recorded rather than left for the next reader to wonder
whether the filter was forgotten, and the calculator has an argument of its own:
it is about *reaching* rather than reading. A tab left open all day is a tab you
reach into for a quick sum, and the alternative is `bc` in a shell you have to
go and find. It is the first panel with no data source behind it at all.

The pomodoro's own case follows. The owner
asked for it directly. Worth recording rather than leaving the next reader to
wonder whether the filter was forgotten. It is arguably a fifth question, "how
is this stretch of work going", and it is the only panel that is *about* the
time you spend at the dashboard rather than about something outside it. That
makes it the one panel where a nagging design would do real damage, which is
why the chime defaults off and a paused timer greys out instead of blinking.
The filter still holds for anything not asked for by name.

**Identified gaps, agreed:** (1) calendar / next event is the biggest hole —
tasks are self-paced, a meeting is externally imposed and time-critical;
(2) nothing shows what *changed* since you last looked; (3) no single "is
anything on fire" signal.

**Rejected:** unread email/message counts. Looks like information, is a
doomscroll hook, turns a calm dashboard into a nagging one.

**Also rejected, after shipping it: the unused-widget notice.** A line in the
status bar and a section in the help overlay naming the widgets your layout
does not place. Removed at the owner's request, and the reason generalises:
*a dashboard cannot tell "has not discovered this yet" from "decided against
it"*, so a hint aimed at the first group reminds the second group for ever.
The status bar half retired on the first keypress; the help overlay half did
not, and that is the one that grated — press `?` and be told about four panels
you deliberately switched off, every time.

This is the unread-badge rejection reached from the direction of helpfulness
rather than of notifications, which is exactly why it got built. `w` remains a
primary binding, so the *capability* is still one keystroke and on the status
bar; what is gone is being told you should use it.
`a_layout_missing_widgets_is_not_advertised_anywhere` renders the dashboard and
the help overlay at 200x40 with twelve widgets unplaced and fails on the word
"unused".

**Calendar must be independent** — no connecting to the user's mail or calendar
server. Read a local `.ics` file or a plain events file.

**Weather deliberately gets less room** than it originally had; it was not among
the four.

**No audio library, ever.** The pomodoro chime is the terminal bell, `\x07`.
Playing a sound file means talking to the platform's audio stack — `rodio`
reaches `cpal` reaches `alsa-sys`, a C library wanting dev headers on every
Linux builder, which would undo the work that got musl and Windows building at
all. The bell costs nothing and defers to settings the user has already made.
Anyone wanting a specific sound names a player in `chime_command`, which is run
directly rather than through a shell. If a future panel wants a notification,
it gets the same answer.

**Sound is off by default and so is anything else that interrupts.** The one
line that decides this: a tab you leave open all day has no business making
noise you did not ask for.

## Stock watchlist — built, in `quote.rs` and `widgets/stocks.rs`

Yahoo Finance `/v8/finance/chart/?range=1d&interval=5m`. Keyless, and one GET
returns the price, previous close, currency *and* the intraday series, so a row
costs exactly one request. **Requires a browser `User-Agent`** or you get HTTP
429 regardless of rate.

- `/v7/finance/quote` is effectively dead (401 without cookie+crumb). Stay on v8.
- Yahoo gates on **IP reputation**, not auth. Datacenter and VPN IPs are blocked
  wholesale. **This is why `QuoteSource` is a trait** — load-bearing, not
  gold-plating: the same build works on a laptop and fails on a VPS, and only a
  different source fixes it. Add one by implementing the trait and adding a name
  to `SOURCE_NAMES` and an arm to `source_for`.
- Unbuilt fallbacks: CNBC quote (batches N tickers in one request, no
  sparkline), Nasdaq chart (sparkline, self-declares delayed). Keyed: Tiingo.
- **Do not use Finnhub** — its ToS restricts *every* tier including paid to
  personal use, so no user can ever become compliant. FMP bans display in
  software products. Alpha Vantage is 25 req/day.
- Never bundle a shared API key; do not persist quotes beyond the session; poll
  ≥60s and stagger requests rather than firing concurrently. All four are
  enforced in code, not just documented.
- **The watchlist is a data file, not config.** That is the only reason the
  panel can add and remove symbols: mirador never rewrites the config, so
  `[stocks].symbols` seeds the first run and nothing after it. Reach for the
  same trick for any other user-editable list.
- `parse_chart` is split from the HTTP call so it is tested against captured
  JSON. **No test in this repo touches the network** — keep it that way.

## Named themes — built

`theme = "name"` resolves through `themes.rs`. Ten themes are `include_str!`-
baked and anything in `<config>/mirador/themes/<name>.toml` is found first, so a
bundled theme can be replaced without renaming it.

Four are mirador's own (`default`, `default-light`, `high-contrast`, `ansi`).
Six are **ports** of palettes from elsewhere — `nord`, `gruvbox`, `dracula`,
`catppuccin-mocha`, `tokyo-night`, `solarized-dark`. Each file cites the
upstream source its hex values came from, and that is the point: someone who
picks `nord` wants Nord. Adjust the *mapping* onto mirador's keys if a palette
reads badly; never adjust the palette. All six keep `text = "reset"`, so body
text still follows the terminal's own foreground — invariant 8 is not suspended
because a theme has a name.

Adding one: write `assets/themes/<name>.toml`, add it to `BUNDLED`. Three things
will bite, and all three are pinned by tests rather than left to memory — the
filename must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`, colour keys must come **before**
`[palette]` and the gradient tables, and a standalone theme must set every one of
`Theme::KEYS`. `inherits` chains with cycle detection; `[palette]`
names colours once, and a child redefining a palette entry recolours the keys
its *parent* set with it — which is why palettes are merged separately from the
colour keys rather than as each document is read.

**The `t` picker previews as the cursor moves**, which is the whole reason it is
usable: a theme you cannot see is a theme you cannot choose. That makes `Esc`
load-bearing — it restores the theme the dialog opened on — and it is why the
dialog holds `(ThemePicker, Theme)` rather than just the picker.

Two things make live preview cheap. Every theme read in the dashboard happens at
*draw* time from `config.theme`, so a swap is one field assignment; and the one
exception, `App::gradients`, is a baked 101-entry ramp that `apply_theme`
re-derives in the same place. Forget the second and the cpu and network graphs
stay in the old palette while everything around them changes, which reads as a
rendering bug rather than a missing line. `a_theme_swap_rebakes_the_gradients_the_graphs_draw_from`
pins it, and `Gradients` derives `PartialEq` purely so it can.

**The choice is remembered in `state.rs`, not written to the config** — and this
is a real departure from the `[layout]` precedent, so it is worth the paragraph.
People *do* curate their theme, which by invariant 16's rule would put it in the
config. What decides it is the shape of the edit: `theme` may be a string *or*
an inline `[theme]` table, and swapping a whole table for a scalar is a textual
rewrite far more dangerous than the single-line `[layout]` edits — which are
safe only because `layout_edit::apply` can re-parse and verify what it wrote.
There is no equivalent check for "did this still mean the same thing". So the
config keeps seeding, `t` records where the user moved, and anyone who wants it
under version control writes `theme = "nord"` themselves.

The consequence to know about: a config `theme` that seems to be ignored means a
state file outranking it. The README and the shipped config both say so, because
the alternative is someone editing a config line that does nothing.

Invariant 17 holds for it by construction — the baseline is `config.theme.name`
taken before `apply_state_theme`, so picking the theme the config already names
*retracts* the entry. Note that `an_untouched_default_config_records_nothing`
cannot see this field: a default config carries an inline table and so names no
theme, leaving both sides `None` whether or not `theme` is in
`only_changes_from`'s hand-written list. `a_theme_matching_the_config_is_not_recorded`
exists because of that, and it was checked by removing the entry and watching it
go red.

**Two items from the original design were deliberately not built**, and the
reasons matter more than the decision:

- **Dotted-scope fallback** (`ui.border.focused` → `ui.border` → `ui`). Helix
  needs it because it has hundreds of syntax scopes and no theme can name them
  all. mirador has thirteen flat semantic keys that a theme can reasonably set
  in full, and `inherits` already covers the rest. The stated benefit — that it
  "makes `border_focused` stop being a special case" — is one field.
- **Full style objects** (fg/bg/modifiers per key). All ~240 theme reads take a
  flat `Color`, nothing wants a themed background (invariant 8), and bold and
  reversed are decided by the widget that knows what it is emphasising.

Both are additions if wanted, not corrections.

**The compat shim is a hand-written visitor, not `#[serde(untagged)]`,** and it
has to stay that way. An untagged enum reports "data did not match any variant"
for every failure, which would destroy both the misspelled-key report and the
`--migrate-config` hint for the pre-0.1.0 `rx`/`tx` keys. The map arm delegates
to the derived impl, so all of that survives; two tests pin it.

**The TOML ordering trap is real and is guarded.** Colour keys written *after*
`[palette]` land inside it and set nothing — nothing is misspelled, nothing
fails to parse, and the theme silently comes out as the defaults. The shipped
`default.toml` was written that way and the test comparing it against
`Theme::default()` **passed**, because a file that sets nothing resolves to
exactly the default. Hence two things: `check_palette_ordering` refuses such a
file by name, and the drift test is paired with one that asserts a standalone
theme *sets every key*, which is the property that can actually fail.

## The "is anything on fire" signal — built

One line in the status bar naming the single most pressing thing, absent
otherwise. `Panel::alert` is the present-tense sibling of `Panel::events`: same
notion of notable, different tense, which is why they are separate hooks.

**The threshold is "will this get worse if nobody acts in the next few
minutes",** and holding that line is the whole feature. An overdue task does not
qualify — notable, already red in its own panel, and identically overdue in an
hour. A signal lit for it is lit permanently, and a permanently lit alarm is
furniture: the unread-badge failure reached from the other direction. Eight of
the thirteen panels already show what is wrong in their own frames, so the gap
this fills was aggregation, never detection.

**No all-clear, ever.** An indicator saying everything is fine is a light you
have to read to learn nothing. Absence is the signal; there is a test.

**It takes the whole bar rather than sharing it.** Squeezing it in beside the
key hints truncated the *reason*, which is the actionable half —
`read-only file syste…`. The keys are behind `?`, and an alert is gone the
moment its cause is.

**`layout_error` was the one genuine silent failure in the program.** It was
reported inside the `w` picker and nowhere else, so a rearrangement that failed
to persist said nothing once the picker closed and was gone at the next launch.
That is now an alert.

## The news panel — built

The one that came closest to the feature this dashboard turned down. Unread
counts were rejected as a doomscroll hook; news *is* the doomscroll surface.
It survives on the same kind of commitment the watch log made, and the same
three words apply: **no count, no unread state, nothing to dismiss**, plus a
fourth — **no scrolling**. It shows what fits. You cannot work through it
because there is nothing to work through. A `3 new` counter in that frame turns
it back into the rejected feature.

**All four are now tested, and two of them were not until 0.17.1.** This
paragraph used to end "there is a test whose failure message says so" — and
there was no such test. Only `watchlog.rs` had one. Worse, the panel *scrolled*:
every story became a `ListItem`, so the selection walked past the bottom and
`List` followed it, which with the shipped feeds left nine of twelve stories
reachable only by scrolling. The rule had been documentation for months
(#118), and the owner chose to keep the rule and change the code rather than
the other way round.

The lesson generalises and is the same one Phase 1 kept finding: **a commitment
nothing checks is a commitment that has already drifted.** `how_many_fit` is now
the one place the rule lives, and `the_panel_builds_only_the_stories_that_fit`,
`the_cursor_cannot_leave_the_visible_stories` and
`the_panel_never_offers_a_counter` are what hold it. Each was verified by
restoring the old behaviour and watching it go red.

**Stories are interleaved across feeds, not sorted by date.** Pure date order
hands the whole visible window to whichever outlet publishes most often — the
first real run showed three consecutive Phys.org stories. Round-robin puts the
newest from each feed at the top, which is what "a window on the world" has to
mean.

**`quick-xml`, where `ical.rs` hand-rolled.** Not an inconsistency: iCalendar is
line-based and yields to `split`, where XML has entities, CDATA and namespaces.
Measured before choosing — `quick-xml` adds two crates, `rss` twenty-three,
`feed-rs` fifty-eight.

**Do not set `trim_text(true)` on the reader.** An entity splits an element's
text into several events, and trimming each piece separately eats the space
beside it: a real headline came out as `'Dead stars'may have`. The assembled
value is trimmed once, at the end. There is a test.

**Headlines only.** Every feed sampled carries 80–384 characters of article
prose in `<description>`. A headline is a fact; a summary is somebody's work.

**A link is now actionable, and the "no browser" rule was narrowed to get
there** (#137). It used to read that no browser is launched at all, "the same
answer this project gave to playing a sound file". That analogy was carrying
more than it could: the sound decision was about a *dependency chain* — `rodio`
reaching `cpal` reaching `alsa-sys`, C headers on every Linux builder — and
spawning a process costs none of that. What actually settled the sound question
was `chime_command`: **mirador does not pick the program, you name it.**
`[news].open_command` is the same answer, empty by default, run directly rather
than through a shell with the link as its own argument.

`y` copies instead, via OSC 52 — a bare escape sequence, the same shape as the
chime being a raw `\x07`. Base64 is hand-rolled in `clipboard.rs` rather than
adding a dependency for twenty lines, which is the `quick-xml` over `rss` trade
again. **It is write-only, so mirador cannot know whether it worked**, and the
footer says it sent the link rather than claiming it copied one. Verified end to
end under tmux with `set-clipboard on`, which does receive it.

**The shipped feeds are science, space and technology.** Choosing outlets for
general or political news is an editorial act this project should not make on
a user's behalf, and it is the kind that arrives in the issue tracker.

## The watch log — built

Fills the third instrument the design thesis named and nothing had ever
occupied. `watch.rs` holds the log and the rule for what belongs in it;
`widgets/watchlog.rs` draws it; panels report through `Panel::events()`,
drained each tick beside `tick()`.

**Three commitments are what keep it on the right side of the unread-count
rejection, and all three are presentational:** no counter in the frame, no
unread state, and no effect on any other panel's appearance. Read the original
objection closely — "looks like information, is a doomscroll hook, turns a calm
dashboard into a nagging one" — and it is about the *badge*, not about
surfacing change. Give this panel a `3 new` counter and it becomes the feature
that was turned down. There is a test whose failure message says so.

**"Since I last looked" is unknowable and the design admits it.** The dashboard
cannot see you looking, and the moments it most needs to be right are the
glances that touch nothing. mirador enables terminal focus reporting, which is
the closest honest signal, and falls back to the last keypress. Where neither
has fired it draws *no* rule line — a line in the wrong place makes a claim,
where a missing one merely says nothing.

**mirador's handling of focus events is verified; their delivery is not.** This
paragraph long said the whole thing was untestable, on the reasoning that a
headless tmux server has no attached client to have focus — true of *observing*
focus, and irrelevant, because focus events are just bytes on stdin.
`tmux send-keys -H 1b 5b 49` is gained and `1b 5b 4f` is lost, and with a rule
line on screen the first left it alone while the second erased it. **Always send
the second as a control:** if the sequences were being swallowed, neither would
do anything, and only one of them proves that.

**Delivery on a bare terminal — verified 2026-07-30, on macOS Terminal.app with
no multiplexer.** This was the last unverified behaviour in the program, and it
passes: an entry that arrived while away drew the rule line, and the line
*survived* coming back, which is #132's fix meeting a real terminal for the first
time.

The method is the part worth keeping, because inferring delivery from mirador's
own screen cannot distinguish "the terminal sent nothing" from "mirador mishandled
it". **Measure the terminal separately.** A dozen lines of Python that put the tty
in raw mode, write `\033[?1004h`, and log stdin to a file answers it outright —
Terminal.app produced exactly `1b5b4f` on leaving and `1b5b49` on returning. Do
that first, then test mirador; two clean signals beat one ambiguous one.

**iTerm2 was checked the same way on 2026-07-31 and behaves identically** — the
same six bytes, the rule line drawn while away and still there on return. Two
independent terminals agreeing is what turns this from an observation into a
reasonable expectation of the next one. Note that iTerm2 asks for confirmation
before running a script handed to it by `open`, which is a dialog to click, not
a failure.

Still untried: any non-Apple terminal. Focus events do not survive zellij and
tmux needs `focus-events on`; the keypress fallback carries the feature wherever
delivery fails.

**One run out of three showed no rule line, and it did not reproduce.** Recorded
because the temptation was to file it. The failing run differed in that the entry
arrived only after the window came forward, so that was made the variable and
tested directly — and the line appeared anyway. The most likely cause is the test
harness rather than mirador: the screenshot tool hides non-allowlisted
applications, which can shuffle focus and deliver transitions nobody asked for.
**An anomaly seen once, in a rig you built that morning, is more likely to be the
rig.** Reproduce before reporting.

**The log does not persist, on purpose.** A file would come back after a restart
with a hole in it — the hours mirador was not running and observed nothing —
and it cannot mark that hole. Same discipline as weather showing a reading's
age rather than implying it is current.

**The day turning is recorded by the shell, not by a panel.** `App` holds the
date for this and no widget owns it. The todo panel notices a rollover too, but
a dashboard whose day-divider vanishes when you switch off the task list would
be strange — and it is the one source that always fires, which is what keeps the
panel from looking broken on a setup with no calendar and nothing falling due.

**The first read of a calendar is not news.** `AgendaPanel::known` is `None`
until the first successful read, so a startup does not announce every event in
your `.ics`. A log that opens with forty entries is a log nobody reads twice.

## A panel dialog is drawn by the shell, not the panel

`Panel::overlay` returns the open prompt and `App::render` draws it after every
panel, beside the help overlay and the picker. This is not tidiness: panels are
drawn in order, so anything a panel paints outside its own rectangle is painted
over by the panels after it. The zone picker was first written to draw itself
and came out interleaved with the task list, because the clock is panel one and
twelve panels are drawn on top of it.

The corollary is that a panel's `render` must stay inside the rectangle it is
given. Nothing enforces it; the failure looks like a corrupt terminal.

## The two reset flags — built, 1.0.4 and 1.1.0

**They are separate commands, not degrees of one.** `--reset-config` is about
configuration; `--factory-reset` is about everything mirador has written. A test
asserts neither flag sets the other, because the day they blur is the day a
config reset quietly takes somebody's task list with it.

**`--reset-config` has to clear `state.toml`, and the reason generalises.**
Remembered preferences are *deltas against the config* and they outrank it — see
invariant 17. Restore the config and leave them, and the deltas are still
measured against a config that no longer exists: the baseline moves and the
overrides do not. So the old preferences were applied straight back over the
file just restored, and the dashboard came back looking untouched. Reported as
"it displayed my previous screen" (#153), and someone who had only ever changed
their theme would have seen the command appear to do nothing at all. **Any
future file that overrides the config has to be cleared here too.**

**Nothing either flag touches is ever deleted.** Every file is renamed to a
numbered `.bak` beside itself through `store::move_aside`. That is not caution
for its own sake — it is what makes a plain `y` an honest confirmation for a
command called factory reset: the prompt lists every affected file by full path,
and the worst outcome is renaming things back rather than lost work. A typed
confirmation word was considered and rejected on those grounds; it would have
diverged from `--reset-config` for no gain, since the file list is what actually
informs the decision.

**What a factory reset may touch is decided by authorship, not location.** If
mirador wrote it, mirador may set it aside. `calendar.ics` is therefore excluded
even though it sits in mirador's own data directory by default — mirador only
ever *reads* a calendar, so that file belongs to the reader, and moving it would
be destroying data the program did not create. Files at paths the reader chose
with `[todo].file` and its siblings are excluded for the same reason; resetting
the config already stops mirador looking there. `the_owned_files_are_the_ones_mirador_writes`
pins both halves — add `calendar.ics` to the list and it fails.

**Why a config reset cannot restore the default tickers, and a factory reset
can.** `[stocks].symbols` seeds `watchlist.toml` only when that file is
*absent*, which is the whole reason the panel can edit the watchlist at all.
Rewriting the config therefore changes nothing; removing the file is what makes
the seed run again. The same is true of the task and notes examples, which
`load_or_seed` keys on absence for the same reason (invariant 18).

`free_backup_path` lives in `store.rs` beside `write_atomic`, not in `config` —
"do not lose the old file" is that module's job, and three callers need it now.

## Contributions from outside — the first two, and what they cost

The project took its first outside changes on 2026-08-01, both from
[@krflol](https://github.com/krflol): notes clipboard editing (#177) and
`mirador --update` (#182). Recorded because the *process* findings outlived
the features.

**Both surfaced a defect of ours rather than only adding one of theirs.** The
first found that two tests spawned `true`, which does not exist on Windows —
green in CI because GitHub's Windows runners ship Git for Windows and it puts a
`true.exe` on `PATH`, red on any ordinary Windows machine. **A green CI is
evidence about the runner as much as about the code.** The second was the reason
anyone looked at the notes reader closely enough to find #178.

**A contributor's PR is measured against a `main` they cannot see the future
of.** Both of theirs passed CI and then failed to merge cleanly, once on a
CHANGELOG collision and once on something sharper: with #177 and #182 both in,
`run()` came to 101 lines against clippy's 100. Neither branch could see it,
because each was measured against a `main` lacking the other. **Test-merge
before merging** — the check that matters is the merged result, not either side.

**`maintainerCanModify` did not work.** The flag was true on both PRs and
pushing to the fork was refused. What actually helps is telling the contributor
exactly what the conflict is — they rebased #177 themselves, unprompted, within
hours of being told the resolution was keep-both.

**The identity question arrives from outside too.**
[Discussion #188](https://github.com/jchultarsky/mirador/discussions/188) asked
for a terminal widget, opened as a discussion rather than a PR *after* the
feature was already built and tested — which is the right way round, and worth
saying so. The answer was that mirador is a pane inside a multiplexer rather
than a replacement for one; that a terminal panel needs `Ctrl+C` for its child,
which is the one key the project guarantees always gets you out; and that what
the case actually wants is a panel that *watches* a process rather than hosts
one. The filter in "Product decisions already settled" now has to hold against
people who do not know it exists.

## Recently settled, so it is not re-litigated

**The calculator is a tape, and the first version was a big number.** It shipped
in 1.3.0 drawing the answer in block numerals, and the owner rejected it on
sight as "too plain … the result is a giant number". The reasoning that produced
it was *the clock and the pomodoro use them*, which is a resemblance and not a
reason. Those two show one continuously changing value you **glance** at, and
the numerals exist so it reads across a room. A calculated answer is read once
and checked against the working that produced it — a different job.

There was an arithmetic tell available the whole time and nobody did the sum:
block numerals cost six cells a digit, so a twelve-digit result wants ninety-four
columns. In the shipped slot the numerals only ever appeared for answers small
enough not to need them.

What replaced it came out of reading what calculators actually are.
[Soulver](https://soulver.app/) was built on the observation that copying a
physical calculator wastes the display, and that the answer belongs *beside* each
line rather than in one register. Printing calculators survive in accounting
because a tape is an **audit trail** — it is what lets you check the entry three
lines back — and they have printed in two ink colours for a century. And
right-alignment of figures is not decoration: it is what puts units under units
so a column can be scanned.

So: the shared grid, a `WORKING` and `RESULT` column, oldest at the top and the
live entry at the foot where a tape feeds from. It is also the design thesis
being followed rather than decorated — the watch station has an adding machine on
it, not a seven-segment display.

Two details are worth keeping. **Results are aligned on the decimal point**, and
the padding that does it counts against the column: a ten-cell answer beside a
two-place fraction was pushed back over the edge and the grid ellipsised it,
which undid the whole reason `fit_result` exists. Alignment gives way before a
digit does. And **the live row is the brightest thing in the panel**, because it
is where the cursor is — the first draft had it dim, which put the faintest
thing on screen exactly where the eye was. Attention runs *down* the panel:
muted tape, body-weight last entry, brass live answer.


**The layout grid stays two levels** — `rows: Vec<Row{height, panels}>` — rather
than becoming recursive splits. Nested splits would make `[layout]` unreadable
and un-hand-editable, and would break the textual-edit approach the whole
persistence story rests on. The known cost is that panels of unlike natural
height in one row waste space; the mitigation is that arrange mode makes it
easy to group like with like.

**The default is four rows of thirteen panels**, re-measured at 120x40 on
2026-08-01 when the calculator joined it: nothing truncates, every panel is
legible and no frame title is clipped.

Where the thirteenth went was decided by arithmetic rather than taste, and the
arithmetic is worth keeping. The instrument row was the obvious home — a
calculator belongs beside the pomodoro and the graphs — and it is the one row
that could not take it. A fifth panel there drops `stocks` from 36 cells to 30
at 120 columns, and it needs 35 to keep the change column that 1.1.2 went to
some trouble to save; `network` loses its upload rate a little further down the
same slope. So it sits on the reading row instead, where the two neighbours are
prose that wraps. **Prose gives way more gracefully than a table does**: a
narrower paragraph is still the whole paragraph, where a dropped column is a
fact the reader no longer has.

The knock-on is worth knowing rather than fixing: jump keys only go up to `9`,
and slots are numbered in row-major order, so the last **four** — `pomodoro`,
`stocks`, `cpu` and `network` — have none.

This paragraph first said `pomodoro` joined `cpu` and `network`. That undercounts
by one and names the wrong set: adding the calculator pushed `stocks` past the
end as well. Worth having recorded, and it went unrecorded in the very paragraph
that spends four lines protecting `stocks` from losing width. The blank space in the clock is
inherent to a row sharing its height with weather rather than being waste to
reclaim. Arrange mode can open, close and now reorder rows, so the row count is a
gesture rather than a number shipped for everyone.

This paragraph said "three rows … all ten panels" until that re-check. It was
true when written and quietly stopped being true when the agenda and news panels
joined the default layout — nothing in the build notices, because no test asserts
the shipped `[layout]` has any particular size. If you add a panel to
`assets/default_config.toml`, this is the sentence that goes stale.

**`layout_edit` has two paths and the split matters.** Numbers-only changes are
still one-line edits, because rebuilding a row would reflow a hand-aligned
block on every `Ctrl+arrow` repeat. Structural changes rebuild the row from
captured panel entries — a panel's line *plus the comments above it*, looked up
across the whole block so a moved panel takes its explanation with it. Before
this, reordering within a row failed *silently*: the loop matched by name, saw
both panels still present, emitted nothing, and the round-trip check refused a
change the user had watched happen.

**Esc cancels in arrange mode and commits in the picker.** Inconsistent, and
deliberate: each picker change is one keystroke to undo, an arrangement is not.
The mode's legend names both keys, so there is nothing to guess.

## The road to 1.0.0

1.0 is not "everything is built" — that was true at 0.14.0. It is a promise, and
the promise has three parts: **your config keeps working, your data files keep
working, and there are no known crashes or hangs.** Everything below exists to
earn one of those three.

Ship 0.x releases freely along the way. A version number is cheap; the 1.0 one
is not, because it is the one people quote back at you.

### Phase 1 — finish the adversarial review

**`themes`: done.** One finding and one non-finding.

A theme name was used as a path component without checking, so
`theme = "../../elsewhere"` read and parsed a file outside the themes
directory. Nothing escalates — the config and anything it reaches belong to the
user — but a name whose meaning depends on where the config happens to live is
not a name, and the failure messages quote whatever it reached. Letters, digits,
dash and underscore now, which admits every bundled name and excludes
separators, `..` and the empty string. `inherits` goes through the same door.

The non-finding is worth as much: `substitute` recurses through nested tables,
and the bound on that recursion is the TOML parser's, not this module's. Fifty
thousand nested inline tables are refused before they ever become a `Table`.
Pinned by a test, because the bound lives in a dependency and would leave with
it.

**`quote`: done, and clean.** No defects. Worth recording *why*, because the
reasons are load-bearing and easy to remove by accident:

- Numbers too large for an `f64` are refused by the JSON parser before any
  guard sees them. That is stronger than a downstream check and it is why no
  downstream check exists — so a future move away from `serde_json`'s strictness
  would need one.
- `change_pct` returns zero rather than infinity for a previous close of zero,
  and the sparkline returns its middle glyph for a series with no span. Both
  divisors are guarded at the point of division.
- Symbols reach the URL through a strict RFC 3986 unreserved allowlist, so
  nothing in a symbol can alter the request — while `.` passes through, which is
  what keeps `BRK.B` working.

All four market-data promises are enforced rather than merely written down, and
were re-checked: no key anywhere, `WatchlistFile` carries symbols and no prices,
`refresh_secs.max(60)`, and `stagger_ms.clamp(100, 10_000)`.

**`store` and `state`: done.** Three findings, all about data rather than
speed.

`write_atomic` used one `.tmp` name per *file*, not per *write*. Two mirador
windows — one per monitor — then raced for it: eight concurrent writers failed
2,100 of 2,400 saves, and a failed save is reported, so the second window filled
with complaints. Behind that sat a narrower hazard: `File::create` truncates, so
a second writer emptied the first's half-written temporary and the first would
have renamed *that* into place. Never reproduced, and it needs no reproducing to
be worth removing. Names are unique per write now.

A rename installs a new file, created per the umask, so `chmod 600` on a task
list was widened to 0644 on the next save. Permissions are carried across.

And invariant 17 was broken again, by a new route. `[agenda].file` ships
commented out, so `from_config` produced `None` while the panel reported a
*resolved* path — they differed, so one keystroke anywhere wrote the resolved
default into the state file, after which editing `[agenda].file` did nothing.
The rule is not only "compare against the config"; it is **compare against the
config in the same terms the panel will report**. A test now asserts that an
untouched default dashboard writes nothing at all.

**Per-frame allocation, swept across twelve of the thirteen panels: no further
offenders.**
Three fixes of the same shape in one day looked systemic, so it was measured
rather than argued about. It was not systemic; the agenda was an outlier.

The property that matters is not the size of the number, it is what the number
scales with. **A panel may allocate in proportion to what is on screen. It must
not allocate in proportion to how much data you have.** The agenda broke that —
a recurring calendar expands, and it cloned the expansion four times a frame —
and nothing else does. Verified by loading 5 items and then 500: `todo` stayed
at 667 allocations a frame both times, `notes` at 783 and 768.

For reference, allocations per frame with each panel alone, on an idle
dashboard. Roughly 150 of each figure is the shell — frames, layout, status bar
— so `cpu`, `network` and the fixed `agenda` are at the floor:

```
notes 1118   calendar 892   todo 885   weather 755   clocks 438
pomodoro 404  stocks 348    watchlog 271  news 252
agenda 175    cpu 174       network 159      (whole dashboard: 1345)
```

The calculator is the thirteenth and is **not** in that table: it shipped after
the sweep and has never been measured. It looks compliant — the tape is capped
and `render` builds only the rows it draws — but nobody has put a counting
allocator behind it, and a panel that accumulates is the one most worth
checking.

Nothing here is worth optimising. A thousand small allocations a frame at about
one frame a second is ordinary work for building styled spans, and the
measurement exists to catch *growth*, not to be minimised.

**To repeat the measurement:** put a counting `GlobalAlloc` in `main.rs`, wrap
the `terminal.draw` call in `App::run` to record the delta, and write it to a
file each frame. `unsafe_code = "forbid"` in Cargo.toml has to be relaxed for
that build, so do it on a scratch branch and check `git status` is clean
afterwards — shipping that lint relaxed would be a worse bug than any it found.
Then generate one config per widget with a single-panel `[layout]` and run each
for a few seconds.

**The fix to copy, if a panel ever does break the rule:** cache the shared state
in the panel when `tick` sees the generation move, and have `render`, `counter`
and `alert` read the cache. `agenda` and `news` both do this.

**`ical` and the agenda panel: done.** The parser itself held up — two
thousand recurring events in 32ms, `COUNT=999999999` clipped by the window,
fifty thousand folded lines and twenty thousand nested components all bounded.
The panel around it did not: `render`, `counter` and two key handlers each
cloned the whole expanded event list, at 210,000 clones per thirty idle seconds
against three hundred daily meetings. `counter` was the worst of them, being
called on every frame with nothing guarding it. All four now read a cache
filled once per tick.

Also bounded the `.ics` read at 10MB, matching what `ureq` already enforces on
the network side. Reading a calendar costs several times its size.

**`theme_picker`: done.** One finding, which is a thin haul and worth saying so
rather than dressing up — the module is mostly declarative drawing, and it was
written with `prompt`'s lessons already in hand.

`render` reserved `self.names.len() + 2` lines and drew at most `ROWS`. With
five thousand themes on disk that is room for 5,012 lines every frame to push
14. Nobody has five thousand themes; the number was never the point. The rule
about allocating in proportion to what is on screen rather than to how much data
sits behind it was written down three days before this module broke it, which is
the useful part of the finding.

**The first test written for it could not fail**, and that is the second useful
part. It counted theme rows reaching the screen — but `take(ROWS)` caps those
whichever way the reservation is written, so it passed with the bug in place.
The fix was to split the line building into `ThemePicker::lines` and weigh the
`Vec`'s own capacity, which is the thing that was wrong. Same trap as the id
reuse test and the `default.toml` drift test; the tell each time is that the
assertion is about a *consequence* that the bug does not actually change.

Non-findings: no panic anywhere from 1x1 to 5x5, with and without a list long
enough to scroll — unlike `prompt`, this module never indexes the buffer itself,
so ratatui's own clipping covers it. And live preview costs about **30µs per
keystroke**, measured across all ten bundled themes, including the filesystem
stat that checks for a user override. That is a fair question to ask of a dialog
that re-resolves a theme on every cursor move, and the answer is that it does not
matter.

**`chart`, `samples` and `glyphs`: done.** Five findings, and the interesting
thing about them is the split: four were *latent* — a hole in a public function
that no current caller can reach — and one was live, in a module these three
led to rather than in any of them.

Latent, all now closed because the guards cost a line each:

- `samples::push_bounded` spun for ever on a capacity of 0. `buffer.len() >= 0`
  is always true for a `usize`, and `pop_front` on an empty deque returns `None`
  without breaking anything. Unreachable through `capacity`, which floors at 1,
  and both callers go through it.
- `chart::BrailleGraph::render` panicked when handed an area larger than the
  buffer, because indexing a `Buffer` out of bounds does. Every ratatui widget
  clamps; this one did not. Panels take their rects from the layout, so nothing
  passes one today.
- `glyphs::width_of` overflows `u16` at about ten thousand characters and panics
  in a debug build. Its two callers pass `"00:00:00"` and a formatted clock.
- `glyphs::utility` can make text *wider*: uppercasing is not one-to-one, so `ß`
  becomes `SS` and `ﬄ` becomes `FFL` — ten characters in, thirty cells out.
  Measuring the argument instead of the result is therefore wrong. Documented on
  the function rather than "fixed", because the behaviour is correct.

Live, and the one that mattered: **`feed` bounded nothing it parsed.** Following
`utility` back to its one caller that takes text mirador did not write —
`news::masthead` — led to the parser, where a story's title, link and source had
no length limit at all. Everything downstream runs per *frame*: the title is
wrapped on every draw and the source uppercased on every draw. Measured before
fixing, a 2 MB headline wrapped to 40,000 lines and cost **72 ms a frame**, and
`ureq`'s body cap allows five times that. A feed is the one input to this program
somebody else writes, and it could decide how much work the dashboard did.
Titles are clipped to 400 characters at parse, links to 1,000, source names to
80 — all far above anything real, and a test pins that an ordinary headline is
untouched.

That is Phase 2's exit criterion for `feed`, reached from Phase 1.

Non-findings, recorded because they were checked rather than assumed: the graph
survives `u64::MAX` data against a `u64::MAX` scale, data far above its scale,
and a scale of zero; `level()` is safe against NaN and infinity because
`f64::max` returns the non-NaN operand and an infinite cast saturates; and
`lerp` cannot leave `0..=255`, because `step` is clamped to `span` first.

**`arrange` and `selection`: done.** Two findings, both in code that had a test
sitting next to it which could not fail.

`promote` broke the one rule its own module header states. Splitting a row's
height in two read `source.height.max(2)`, so a row of height **1** produced two
rows of 1 and grew the total by one — and heights are relative weights, so
`[1, 1]` becoming `[1, 1, 1]` takes an untouched row from half the screen to a
third of it. Reachable without doing anything odd: `LayoutRow::default()` is
height 1, nothing in `validate` bounds heights, and a `[[layout.rows]]` entry
written without a `height` gets the default. It now doubles every row before
splitting, which preserves every proportion exactly, and a height of 0 stays 0
rather than being forced up to 2.

`a_move_never_changes_what_the_weights_add_up_to` could never have caught it —
every height in its fixture is comfortably above two. The replacement asserts
the property the rule is actually about: an untouched row keeps its *share*.

`selection::up` did not clamp its starting index against `len` where `down`
always had. A list that gets shorter can leave the selection past its end —
`news` and `watchlog` both bound movement by what they last managed to *draw*,
so making the panel shorter does exactly that — and the two directions then
disagreed: `down` pulled a stale index back into range, `up` walked it down one
row at a time with nothing highlighted the whole way. This is the same complaint
as the zone picker's missing scroll, one module over.

Non-findings worth recording. `row_at` maps one screen row to one list index,
which would be wrong for a multi-line `ListItem` — `news` builds one — but news
does not use `row_at`; only `todo`, `notes` and `stocks` do, and all three draw
one line per row. And `insertion_point` cannot divide by zero or see a NaN,
because `weight` floors each panel at 1.

Found while driving arrange mode in a real terminal, and left as a known
limitation rather than fixed: **`layout_edit` can only rewrite the
`rows = [ … ]` form**, not a layout spelled with `[[layout.rows]]` sections.
Both load; only one can be edited. That is not silent — it is an alert — but the
message said "no `[layout]` rows found" about a file that visibly has rows,
which reads as a bug. It now names the form it wants, front-loaded so the useful
clause survives the status bar's truncation on a narrow terminal.

**`layout_edit` and `migrate`: done.** Found that both flattened CRLF to LF —
`str::lines()` strips the `\r`, so a Windows config was rewritten entirely
because one panel moved. `store::line_ending` now carries the file's own ending
through both. `migrate` had a third site the first fix missed, in a `writeln!`
that hard-codes `\n`; the test caught it, which is the argument for writing the
test before believing the fix.

Also added: eighty-eight structural mutations of the *real shipped config*,
asserting the only two acceptable outcomes — applied and exactly right, or
refused and untouched. "Wrote something plausible" is the outcome this module
exists to make impossible.

One pass covered the code written on 27 July and found a hang and two per-frame
allocation faults. The rest of the program has not had the same treatment.

**Phase 1 is complete.** Every module has been read adversarially, and every
finding is either fixed or recorded above with the reason it was left.

Two patterns ran through the whole pass and are worth carrying into Phase 2.
**Most findings sat next to a test that could not fail** — counting characters
where cells were the bug, summing weights where proportions were the bug,
counting drawn rows where the allocation was the bug. The tell is always that
the assertion is about a consequence the bug does not change. And **the live
defects clustered at the edges**: unbounded third-party feed text, a terminal
resized to one column, a list that got shorter. The interior arithmetic was
mostly right.

### Phase 2 — harden the untrusted-input boundary

Five things consume input nobody here controls: `ical` (your `.ics`), `feed`
(third-party RSS), `layout_edit` and `themes` (hand-edited TOML), and
`grid::wrap` — which is where the hang was, fed by third-party headlines.

That is not a coincidence and it is the strongest signal from the review: the
one hang found was at exactly this boundary, in the one function that loops over
attacker-influenced text. Property tests over generated input are the cheap
version and want no new tooling; a fuzz target is the thorough one and wants
nightly.

**`ical`: done.** Three findings, two of them crashes, and the pass is worth
reading as a lesson about Phase 1 rather than only about this module.

Phase 1 declared `ical` clean. It had tested the parser at **scale** — two
thousand recurring events, `COUNT=999999999`, fifty thousand folded lines,
twenty thousand nested components — and never varied the *alphabet* or the
*shape*. Both crashes were sitting in plain sight the whole time:

- `vevents` read `line.len() > 6 && line[..6].eq_ignore_ascii_case("BEGIN:")`.
  Slicing a `&str` at a byte offset panics when that offset falls inside a
  character, so any line in a `VEVENT` with a multi-byte character straddling
  byte 4 or 6 brought the dashboard down. `日本語日本語` does it; so does
  `abcé`. A calendar is somebody else's file and international text in one is
  not an edge case. Now `starts_with_ci`, comparing bytes.
- `INTERVAL=999999999` with `FREQ=DAILY` panicked *inside jiff*: `Span::days`
  panics rather than erroring above about seven million. Now the `try_` setters,
  with a refusal treated as a rule that has run out of road. Deliberately not a
  constant of our own — encoding jiff's bounds here would be a second copy of a
  dependency's number, the same trap the TOML nesting bound in `themes` avoids.

The third is memory, and it is the one the byte cap was supposed to prevent.
`read_calendar` refuses a `.ics` over 10MB, but **the cost of reading one is per
line, not per byte**: every line becomes a `String` in a `Vec`, and a `String`
is 24 bytes before it holds anything. Measured at a flat 24x — a 10MB file of
bare newlines produced **240MB of `Vec`** before a single event was parsed.
`MAX_LINES` now caps it at 400,000, which is more lines than a maximally-folded
10MB calendar holds, and hitting it is reported through `Calendar::skipped`
rather than silently losing the rest.

The generator that found the second one lives at the foot of the module. It is
hand-rolled and deterministic — `proptest` and `arbitrary` both do this better
and neither is worth a dependency here, because what matters is the *corpus*.
Every fragment in it is there because of something in the parser, not sampled
from all possible bytes. 40,000 generated calendars run clean at a worst case of
235µs; the committed test runs a subset that fits CI, and `probe_wide_sweep` is
`#[ignore]`d for the full run.

**`grid::wrap`: done.** Three findings. The module's own arithmetic was the
smaller half — the larger one was that mirador was handing the same text to
*ratatui's* wrapper, which crashes on it.

**The live crash: `Paragraph::wrap` indexes past the end of the buffer.** Two
ways in, both reachable without doing anything unusual. A double-width glyph
inside a word too long for a **two-cell** area — `"a🌞b"` is enough — and a
**leading combining mark**, a grapheme with no base character, which throws the
accounting off at *any* width. It is a panic, not a misdraw: the dashboard dies.
Reachable from a note, a task's notes, or a fetch error, and emoji in prose is
ordinary. The height matters as much as the width, which is why nothing had ever
seen it: the fault lands on a *later* row, so a one-row pane never reaches it.

The fix is that **ratatui never wraps anything mirador did not write**.
`grid::wrapped` wraps first and the `Paragraph` is given no `Wrap` at all, which
keeps wrapping in the one module that measures in cells and is tested against a
corpus of wide glyphs. Four sites moved: the note title and body, the task form's
message, and the task notes; plus weather's fetch error, which comes off the
network. Two `Wrap` calls remain on purpose — the help overlay and the delete
confirmation are code-written ASCII, and the confirmation's one variable line is
already `truncate`d to the width, so neither ever wraps untrusted text.

`ratatuis_own_wrapper_is_why_this_module_wraps_first` pins the dependency bug the
way the TOML nesting bound is pinned, and **says in its failure message that a
fix upstream is good news** rather than something to delete the assertion over.
Reported as [ratatui#2679](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/issues/2679), with
a standalone repro and two passing controls — the same text without the leading
mark, and plain ASCII at width 2 — since what makes the report useful is the
pair that *does not* crash. The root cause is `render_line` advancing `x` by each
grapheme's width and indexing the buffer unguarded, trusting `WordWrapper` never
to yield a line wider than the area; that invariant is what breaks.

The other two were in this module, and both are the Phase 1 pattern again:

- **`wrap` and `wrapped_height` had drifted**, in both directions. The height
  measured an over-long word by subtracting `width` a row at a time, which is
  only right when every glyph is one cell — `日本語` at width 3 wraps to three
  rows and measured two, and `中文标题` at width 1 wraps to four and measured
  eight. A panel sizes itself with one and draws with the other. They are one
  function with two consumers now, so they agree by construction; the counting
  path still allocates nothing, which is what a scroll clamp over a whole note
  body needs.
- **A blank row after a line consumed exactly.** `wrap("🌞🌞", 1)` came out as
  three rows, the last one empty — a wasted line under every headline that ends
  on a boundary. A blank line the author *wrote* still gets its row.

`wrapping_produces_exactly_as_many_rows_as_it_measures` sat directly on top of
the first of those and passed throughout, because every sample in it was ASCII
and every width was 8 or more. Not a test that could not fail — a test that was
never handed the input that would fail it, which is the same thing in practice.
Both fixes were checked by breaking them on purpose.

**`layout_edit`: done.** Two findings, and the pass is mostly a lesson about
which *axis* a sweep varies.

Phase 1's `no_mutation_of_the_shipped_config_produces_a_wrong_file` runs
eighty-eight mutations — of the **desired layout**, against one fixed piece of
text. The text is the half a person edits by hand, and it was never varied at
all. That is the `ical` shape exactly: tested at scale on one axis, never on the
alphabet or the shape of the other. `no_mutation_of_the_config_text_produces_a_wrong_file`
is the missing half — CRLF, tabs, no spaces around `=`, CJK and emoji and
combining marks and RTL text in the comments, quotes inside comments, numbers at
the edges of their type. Its coverage is asserted *exactly*, because three of
the mutations are invalid TOML on purpose and a sweep that quietly stopped
parsing its own fixtures would pass while testing nothing.

**That exact assertion promptly failed on Windows, and the reason is a trap
worth keeping.** This repository has no `.gitattributes`, so a Windows checkout
writes `assets/default_config.toml` with CRLF — and a mutation that replaces
every `\n` then produces `\r\r\n` and stops being the mutation it is named
after. Two of the eighteen quietly became invalid TOML, so 13 parsed where 15
were asserted. The asymmetry that hides this is the part to remember:
**rustc normalises CRLF to LF inside string literals, and `include_str!` does
not.** So a fixture written as a `const` in the source is LF on every platform
while one pulled in from a file is whatever git wrote, and two tests that look
identical are not. Anything built on `include_str!` should normalise first.
Reproduced locally by converting the fixture before use, which is also how the
fix was checked — the sweep now passes under either checkout.

**A widget named twice silently destroyed a comment.** Entries are looked up by
widget name, so a name used twice has no entry that is unambiguously its own:
rebuilding a row wrote one of the two entries for *both* panels, so the
surviving comment captioned a panel it did not describe and the other was gone.
The layout came out correct, which is why the round-trip check passed it — **a
shape comparison cannot see a lost comment**, and comments surviving is the
entire reason this module edits text instead of reserialising. Neither the
picker (a toggle) nor arrange mode can produce a duplicate, so the file is
hand-written; refusing is what this module already does when it cannot edit
confidently.

The refusal is **as narrow as the problem**, and that is the part worth keeping.
Only a rebuild reuses an entry, so the check sits in `panel_lines` rather than at
the top of `apply`: a plain `Ctrl+arrow` resize rewrites digits on the lines they
are already on, touches no entry, and still works in a file like this. Both
directions are pinned — remove the guard and
`a_widget_named_twice_is_refused_rather_than_losing_a_comment` fails; widen it to
the top of `apply` and `a_resize_still_works_even_where_a_rebuild_would_not`
fails. Checked by doing both.

**`after_key` spun for ever on an empty key.** `find("")` matches at the cursor
and consumes nothing. Unreachable — all four callers pass literals — and guarded
anyway, for the same reason as `samples::push_bounded` at capacity zero: one
line, and a hang is the one failure a dashboard cannot recover from.

Non-findings, recorded because they were checked rather than assumed. Edits are
sorted by anchor and applied in reverse, and an insertion anchored where a
deleted row's span begins looked like it could collide; it does not, and the
rows come out in order. And every byte-offset slice in the module — `strip_comment`,
`quoted_value`, `after_key`, `set_number` — indexes at a character boundary by
construction, so the multi-byte panic that `ical` had cannot happen here.

**`themes`: done.** Two findings, and both are about the same thing Phase 1
missed here: it read this module for *correctness* and found the path traversal,
but never asked what anything **cost**.

**Nothing bounded the size of a theme file.** `ical` got a 10MB cap for exactly
this and `themes` had none, which matters far more than the size of a theme
suggests — **the `t` picker re-resolves from disk on every cursor move.** That
is what makes live preview work, and it puts the cost of reading a theme on an
arrow key. Measured: an 8MB file took **233ms** to resolve against the ~30µs
the bundled ones cost, which is not a slow picker but one that appears to have
hung. `inherits` then multiplies it by up to `MAX_DEPTH`, and the depth check
runs *after* each file is read — a chain of twenty 2MB files read 34MB before
refusing on depth. `MAX_THEME_BYTES` is 256KB, more than a hundred times the
largest bundled theme at 1,788 bytes, and the read is bounded with `take` rather
than by trusting a length from `metadata` — asking how big a file is and then
reading it are two different facts, and only one of them bounds the allocation.

**The error message quoted the offending value whole.** A two-megabyte colour
string produced a two-megabyte error, built and then *discarded* on every cursor
move in the picker. Same shape as the unbounded headline in `feed`, reached from
the other end. Clipped to 40 characters, which is still twice any real colour.

Non-findings, recorded because they were checked. Three thousand generated theme
documents — palette tables shadowing colour keys, `inherits` pointing at itself,
values of the wrong type, empty and multi-byte colour strings, unclosed
gradients — produced no panic and no hang. Cycle detection is by name and holds.
And `parse_color` cannot panic on any input, because ratatui's `Color: FromStr`
returns a `Result`; the danger there was never the parse, only what the failure
message did with what it was handed.

*Exit criterion met.* No arbitrary input to any of the five produces a panic, a
hang, or unbounded memory.

**Phase 2 is complete.** The pattern across all five is worth carrying into
Phase 4: the interior logic was mostly right, and what was missing was a
*bound* — on a headline, on a calendar's line count, on a wrapped row, on a
theme file, on the text an error message quotes back. Four of the five findings
in the last two modules were reached by asking "what does this cost when the
input is hostile", not "is this correct".

### Phase 3 — soak

**Closed.** All four items are verified, and three of them were closed by the
owner on a real terminal between 28 and 30 July — which this section went on
denying for a day afterwards, so read the dates rather than the prose if the two
ever disagree again.

- **Windows — done, 2026-07-28.** Installed and run through the PowerShell
  installer, twice, including `mirador-update`. Every shipped binary on every
  shipped target has now been executed at least once.
- **A real midnight — done, 2026-07-29.** The owner saw
  `00:00 Wednesday 29 July began` in the watch log at the rollover. Until then it
  had only met a test that winds the date back.
- **A full day idle — done, 2026-07-30.** A 15-hour RSS log at 15-minute
  intervals went **23436 → 22592 KB, net −844 KB** — it *ends lower than it
  starts*, oscillating in a band of roughly 19224–23796 KB. Allocator churn and
  page reclaim, not accumulation. **Do not draw a trend from two RSS samples of
  this program**: an earlier pair read as "+3548 KB in 5–6 h" and looked like a
  leak, when both samples simply landed at different points in the same cycle.
- **Terminal focus reporting — answered, and the answer has two halves.**
  *mirador's handling is verified*: focus events are bytes on stdin, so
  `tmux send-keys -H 1b 5b 49` (gained) and `1b 5b 4f` (lost) inject them, and
  with a rule line on screen the first left it alone while the second erased it.
  Always send the second as a control — if the sequences were being swallowed,
  neither would do anything. *Delivery is a terminal question, not mirador's*:
  *focus events do not survive zellij*, the same shape as the documented tmux
  caveat that needs `focus-events on`. Still untested is a bare terminal with no
  multiplexer, which is a far narrower gap than "never verified".

*Exit:* the list of unverified behaviour is empty.

### Phase 4 — freeze the formats and say so

1.0 means a config written today opens in 1.9. That needs an audit rather than
an assumption: every key in `assets/default_config.toml` reachable and
documented, every data file (`todos.toml`, notes, `watchlist.toml`,
`zones.toml`, `state.toml`, `update-check.toml`) either forward-compatible or
migrated, and `migrate.rs` covering every rename ever shipped.

**Done.** The audit found the formats in better shape than expected and one
real defect, and the useful part is which of the three sub-questions had a
mechanical answer.

**No option that ever shipped has been removed.** Checked by extracting every
key from `assets/default_config.toml` at all thirty-one release tags and
diffing: 78 keys, none lost. So `migrate.rs` covering "every rename ever
shipped" was already true — its four rules are all pre-`0.1.0`, and there has
been nothing to migrate since.

Two cautions about that check, because it was wrong twice before it was right.
The first version used `awk` with `[ \t]`, which BSD awk does not read as a tab,
and it produced *zero* keys for every tag — an empty diff that looked exactly
like "nothing was removed". The second correctly found two keys that appeared to
have vanished, `calendar.chime_command` and `agenda.chime_command`; both were
artifacts of counting `#   chime_command = [...]` *examples inside a prose block*
and attributing them to whatever section header came before. A commented default
in this file is written `# key = value` with one space, and an illustration is
indented further; the rule that tells them apart is what makes the audit mean
anything.

**The commented-out defaults were documentation nothing verified.**
`deny_unknown_fields` proves every *live* key is real — a stale one would fail to
parse — but says nothing about the six commented ones, which are precisely the
ones a user uncomments. `every_commented_out_default_is_a_key_that_still_exists`
uncomments each on its own and parses the result, so a key renamed in the code
with its example left behind fails here rather than on somebody's config.

**The one defect: `state.toml` used `deny_unknown_fields`.** One key from a newer
mirador made an older one discard *every* preference in the file rather than the
key it did not know. `UiState` gained fields at `0.9.0` and again at `0.15.0`, so
two versions against one synced config directory hit it twice already. The old
behaviour was recorded as deliberate — "silently keeping half a file is worse" —
and that reasoning does not survive contact with this particular file: nobody
hand-writes it, so there is no typo for strictness to catch, and an older binary
drops the unknown value on its next save regardless. Ignoring it is strictly less
loss. Now the only strict one is `update-check.toml`, which is a cache; the worst
a stale one costs is one extra version check.

Everything else was already right. `todos.toml`, the notes file and
`watchlist.toml` have not changed shape since `0.1.0` — verified by diffing the
structs against the `v0.1.0` tree, not by reading them — and none of the data
files refuse an unknown key.

*Exit met:* the README has a **Compatibility** section, and its claims are
pinned by tests rather than asserted — `the_compatibility_promise_about_configs_holds`
for the config half and `a_task_file_survives_a_version_in_either_direction`
for the data half. A promise nothing checks is the same shape as a test that
cannot fail.

### Phase 5 — cut 1.0.0

**Done, 2026-07-30.** Phases 1–4 were complete and the owner called it; the
version number was not waiting on a date.

The compatibility audit was re-run against **all thirty-one release tags** before
tagging — 1860 key-comparisons, nothing removed — rather than trusting the
twenty-two-tag figure from the Phase 4 audit. **The first three attempts at that
re-run all reported a clean pass while comparing nothing**, which is worth more
than the result: `"$t:assets/…"` in zsh applies the `:a` *absolute path*
modifier to `$t`, so every `git show` failed and every tag yielded an empty key
set that trivially contained no losses. Write `"${t}:path"`, and have the check
count what it actually compared so a vacuous pass cannot look like a real one.

## Feature freeze — lifted 2026-07-30

**The freeze is over**, and has been since before 1.0.0 — it ended the day it
was lifted, in the releases leading up to that tag. Nothing below is a live
constraint; it is kept for the reasoning.
The owner lifted it on 2026-07-30. What is written below is what it was for and
why it was allowed to end, because the reasoning is the part worth keeping —
the rule itself is now history.

**What it said:** new features frozen ahead of 1.0.0, bug fixes and
documentation and tests only, anything adding a panel or a key or a config value
waits. **What it was for:** to find out what the last round actually broke.
Adversarial review had found one hang and two per-frame allocation faults in
code written the same day, all in paths the tests exercised and the tests did not
catch — the hang needed a two-cell glyph in a one-cell column, and nothing was
going to guess that from reading. Building on top of that would have hidden it.

**Why it ended.** The freeze was a question, not a policy, and the question got
answered. 0.16.3 was driven end to end in a real terminal — every panel, every
key, both exit paths, extreme resizes — and soaked for 9h42m. That turned up two
defects, both stale-state and both small (#119, #120, fixed in #121), plus one
documentation finding (#118). Nothing structural. A freeze whose purpose is to
surface breakage stops earning its keep once a full pass comes back that quiet.

**What did not change:** 1.0.0 was a promise about config compatibility,
data-file compatibility, and no known crashes or hangs — see the road map above,
and it was not cut because a date arrived. **The soak is now a gate rather than a
habit:** run it once, on the build about to be tagged.

That paragraph used to end by saying no soak had yet crossed a real midnight. It
was wrong when it was written — the owner watched the rollover on 2026-07-29 and
Phase 3 records it — and it is the **second** retraction of that same claim, the
first being PR #140. Both times it survived because it sat in a subordinate
clause of a paragraph about something else, so nobody rereading the section it
belonged to ever saw it. When a fact is retired, grep for it.

One consequence to be deliberate about: several issues were parked as post-1.0
*because of* the freeze rather than on their own merits — #100, #109, #111 and
the #117/#118 news design among them. **All four shipped the same day the freeze
lifted**, across 0.17.0, 0.17.1, 0.18.0 and 0.18.1, which is the evidence that
the parking was the freeze talking rather than the merits.

The habit is still worth keeping, though: ask before assuming a parked issue is
in a release. #117 is the case in point — it was filed with a chosen direction,
and by the time it was built #118 had changed the panel underneath it enough to
reverse that choice. **A design decision made before a related change may not
survive it.** Re-measure rather than implementing what the issue says.

## Open work

**The tracker is empty.** [#178](https://github.com/jchultarsky/mirador/issues/178)
was the last entry and shipped in 1.4.1 — the notes reader wrapped a whole note
body on every frame and then scrolled past most of it, so drawing cost what the
note weighed rather than what the pane showed. The task panel had the identical
defect one panel over. Both are cached now, and the cost is flat in the size of
the note.

There is an open **discussion**, which is not the same as an open issue:
[#188](https://github.com/jchultarsky/mirador/discussions/188) proposes a
terminal widget. The answer given was that mirador is a pane *inside* tmux or
zellij rather than a replacement for one, and that what the proposer actually
wants — to be told when a long task finishes — is a panel that *watches* a
process rather than one that hosts a shell. Recorded here because it is the
first identity question the project has been asked from outside.

This heading has now described the wrong issue as the last one three times —
#132, then #153, now #153 again after #178 closed. The entry is written when
work starts and nothing makes anybody revisit it when the work lands.

This heading has twice described an issue as open for a day after it was closed
— #132 before #153. That is the failure it is most prone to, and it is the same
one the freeze section had: an entry is written when work starts and nothing
makes anybody revisit it when the work lands.

Everything from the original product analysis is built — the `.ics` agenda,
the watch log, and the on-fire signal — along with named themes and the `t`
picker over them, arrange mode with row movement, and in-panel editing for
everything the UI can change.

That is a fact about the *list*, not a claim the program is finished. The
last untested condition — a **bare terminal with no multiplexer** — was closed on
2026-07-30 against macOS Terminal.app, which reports focus and drew the rule line
correctly. See the watch log section for the method and for the one anomalous run
that did not reproduce. iTerm2 was checked on 2026-07-31 and matches. What
remains is breadth rather than doubt: no non-Apple terminal has been tried, and
focus events still do not survive zellij.

One thing is parked on its merits rather than forgotten. **OSC 8 hyperlinks**
were the third mechanism in the news-link design; `y` and `[news].open_command`
shipped and this did not. It would make a link genuinely clickable, which is
better than either, and it fights ratatui's renderer: cells are written as cells,
not as escape sequences, and a *wrapped* link has to carry the same target across
several rows. It wants a prototype before it wants a promise. Note also that
1.0.0 is out, so anything that changes a config key or a data file now costs a
major version.

When something goes back on this list, put the *reason* beside it. Every entry
that was ever useful here said why it mattered; the one that got quietly dropped
and had to be added back was the one that did not.

## Housekeeping

- **`docs/demo.gif` is regenerated by `docs/record-demo.sh`**, which drives a
  real build under tmux, samples the screen, and hands an asciicast to
  [`agg`](https://github.com/asciinema/agg) — a single Rust binary, deliberately
  chosen over `vhs` because `brew install vhs` pulls in ffmpeg, Go and cmake for
  a job that needs none of them.

  ```sh
  cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/asciinema/agg
  ./docs/record-demo.sh
  ```

  Four things in that script are load-bearing and none of them are obvious:

  - **Build before redirecting `HOME`.** The recording uses a throwaway home so
    it shows a genuine first run, but rustup keeps its toolchain config under
    the real one and a cargo that cannot find it refuses to pick a compiler.
  - **Normalise the cast so the first event is at t=0.** Otherwise the first
    capture lands a few milliseconds in, `agg` faithfully renders those
    milliseconds of empty terminal, and the GIF opens on a black frame — the one
    a still preview shows, and a flicker on every loop.
  - **150x42, not smaller.** The clock drops its block numerals when its row is
    short, and those numerals are the one thing in mirador that looks like
    nothing else.
  - **The order of the segments is now taste, not a workaround.** It used to
    matter: toggling any panel rebuilt every panel, so starting the pomodoro
    before the picker segment recorded the timer silently resetting, and the
    weather and stocks panels spent a fetch cycle showing "loading" afterwards.
    `rebuild_panels` carries panels across now, so neither happens.

- **The README's images float; its prose does not.** `docs/demo.gif` is
  referenced by absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/...` URL, because
  `Cargo.toml` excludes `/docs`, `*.gif` and `*.png`, and a relative path would
  render on GitHub and 404 on crates.io. The consequence is easy to miss:
  replacing the capture updates it on *every* published version at once, while
  the caption and alt text around it stay frozen at whatever each release baked
  in. 0.3.0 spent an hour showing the pomodoro panel above a caption explaining
  that the shot predated it. A caption that describes the picture has to ship in
  the same release as the picture.

  **`docs/screenshot.png` is no longer in the README and must not be deleted.**
  0.1.0 through 0.5.1 all shipped a README pointing at that URL, and those
  READMEs are frozen on crates.io. Removing the file would break the image on
  six published pages that nobody can edit. It costs nothing to keep — `/docs`
  never reaches the crate — so it stays as an asset the past still needs. The
  same will be true of `demo.gif` the day something replaces it.

- Originally built in a Linux container, where `sysinfo`'s macOS CPU and network
  paths went unexercised. Both have since been run on macOS against a real
  terminal under `tmux` and report sensible figures. Windows has since been run
  too — see the platform note below.
- **`1.5.0` is released**, on crates.io and as a GitHub release with binaries
  for macOS arm64, macOS x86-64, Linux x86-64 and Windows x86-64. This line goes
  stale every release and is worth a glance before you trust anything near it;
  `git tag --list 'v*' | sort -V | tail -1` is the truth — it had been four
  releases behind by the time anybody noticed. `0.0.0` is still on
  crates.io below it — the name reservation that went out first, since
  reservation is first-come with no reclamation.

  Cutting a release is a tag push and a `cargo publish`, in that order. Bump
  the manifest, commit, *then* tag: a tag that disagrees with `version` in
  Cargo.toml is refused. The workflow does **not** publish to crates.io — that
  step stays manual and comes after the tag.

  **`main` is protected, so "commit" there means *merged*, not committed
  locally.** The version bump reaches `main` through a PR like anything else,
  and the tag belongs on the squashed commit that lands. Tagging the local
  commit first appears to work — the tag pushes, the workflow runs, the
  artifacts are correct — and then the squash orphans the commit underneath
  it, so `git describe` on `main` cannot see the release. 0.8.0 is tagged that
  way and was deliberately left alone: the trees are byte-identical, and
  force-moving a tag re-triggers the release workflow against a release that
  already exists, which is a worse problem than the wart it fixes. Merge
  first, then tag.

  **Every artifact carries a GitHub provenance attestation**, via
  `github-attestations = true`. Verified working at 0.5.0 for both an archive
  and a `-update` binary, both tracing to
  `release.yml@refs/tags/v0.5.0`:

  ```sh
  gh attestation verify --repo jchultarsky/mirador mirador-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
  ```

  Two traps when checking it. `gh attestation verify` prints its success banner
  only to a TTY, so redirecting it gives an empty file that looks like a
  failure; and `$?` after a pipe reports the *pipe's* exit status, not `gh`'s.
  Confirm the check is real by pointing it at a repo that did not build the
  artifact — that must exit 1 with a 404. Nothing else is manual — targets, checksums,
  installers and release notes are all the workflow's job.

- **`.github/workflows/release.yml` is generated by `dist` and must not be
  hand-edited.** It is build output. Change `[workspace.metadata.dist]` in
  Cargo.toml and run `dist generate`; the workflow also runs `dist plan` on
  every pull request, so drift surfaces there.

  ```sh
  cargo install cargo-dist --locked   # the binary is `dist`
  dist plan                           # what a release would produce
  dist plan --tag=v0.1.0              # what that exact tag would produce
  dist generate                       # rewrite release.yml after a config change
  ```

  `dist init` will try to set `[profile.dist] lto = "thin"`, which quietly
  undoes the `lto = true` in `[profile.release]`. That override is deliberately
  removed — every release so far has been fat-LTO'd and there is no reason for
  the binaries to get slower. If you re-run `init`, check it has not come back.

  `dist` provides its own version-tag guard (`dist plan --tag=v9.9.9` exits
  255) and its own prerelease detection from the semver hyphen, which is why
  the hand-written versions of both were dropped when it took the file over.

- **Windows runs**, confirmed by the owner on 25 July 2026 and again on
  28 July — so all three shipped targets have been started, not merely built.
  Treat it as the least-travelled of the three rather than as unknown: macOS and
  Linux are used daily and Windows has been checked twice.

  Both runs came through the **PowerShell installer** (`irm … | iex`) in the
  default Windows terminal, which is the only real-world exercise of that path —
  everything else about the installers has only been checked from macOS. The
  second run also exercised **`mirador-update` on Windows**, which until then had
  been installed alongside by the same installer and never run there. Every
  shipped binary on every shipped target has now been executed at least once.

  **Running an installer edits the real shell profile, and `HOME` does not stop
  it.** The shell and PowerShell installers append a `. <prefix>/env` line to
  `~/.zshrc` and `~/.profile` so the new binary lands on `PATH`. Pointing `HOME`
  at a scratch directory contains the *install* and not the *profile edit*, so
  the lines are written to the real files and outlive the test.

  This is not hypothetical. Two such lines sat in `~/.zshrc` and two more in
  `~/.profile` from an installer test that used a temporary directory; the
  directory was later reaped and every new terminal then opened with

  ```
  /Users/julian/.zshrc:.:127: no such file or directory: /private/tmp/.../scratchpad/inst/env
  ```

  Nothing failed at the time, which is what made it survive. The install worked,
  the test passed, and the breakage arrived weeks later when something unrelated
  cleaned up the directory — by which time the cause was nowhere near the
  symptom.

  So: **after testing an installer, grep the shell profiles and take the lines
  back out.**

  ```sh
  grep -n "$TMPDIR\|/private/tmp\|/var/folders" ~/.zshrc ~/.profile ~/.zprofile ~/.zshenv
  ```

  Back the files up before editing them, and start a real login shell
  afterwards — `zsh -l -i -c true` — because a profile that fails to source is
  the one kind of damage you cannot see from inside the session that caused it.

  `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` is deliberately absent because `ring`, reached
  through `ureq`'s TLS, does not build for it. musl is absent for the same
  C-toolchain reason. `ring` is also why the Windows target cannot be
  cross-checked from macOS — `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
  fails locally on `cc`, and that is the host missing MSVC rather than anything
  wrong with the code.

- macOS notarization is unsupported by `dist` and does not matter here:
  Gatekeeper's quarantine flag comes from browsers, not `curl`, so
  shell-installer users never see a prompt. Not worth $99/yr for a TUI.
